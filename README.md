Top Five Comedy Movies of Each Decade (1940s onwards)

Introduction:

This project presents a curated list of the top five comedy movies from each decade, starting from the 1940s. Each selection is accompanied by links to trailers and to full-length movies available on YouTube. The project is designed to provide movie enthusiasts with a nostalgic journey through the evolution of comedy over the years. The academy awards do not have a specific category as they do for other genres like drama or animation.
A journey through laughter: The evolution of comedy in cinema:
In the grand tapestry of cinematic history, comedy has always held a place of honor, evoking laughter and joy, offering solace and escape, and providing a mirror to quirks and follies of our society. From the slapstick genius of the 1940s to the sophisticated satire of recent years, the landscape of comedy is as diverse as it is delightful.
This project is a tribute to the timeless magic of laughter as seen through the lens of the greatest comedy movies of each decade since the 1940s. It is an homage to the brilliant minds that crafted these stories- the writers, directors and most notably, the actors whose impeccable timing and expressive artistry have etched these joyous moments into the annals of cinematic history.
As we enjoy frm the black and white classics of the early twentieth century to the vibrant tales of the modern era, we witness not just the evaluation of comedic storytelling but also the changing contours of our culture and society. Each clip is a window into the era it represents, reflecting the humor sensibilities, social norms, and artistic styles of its time.
This compilation is more than just a collection of movie scenes; it is celebration of human spirit, a testament to our innate desire to find joy and laughter even in the face of lifeâ€™s many challenges. It is an invitation to reminisce, to rediscover forgotten gems, and to revel in the memories of laughter-filled movie theaters.
May these timeless classics remind us that laughter is indeed a universal language, one that transcends time and binds us in shared joy and amusement.
In my quest to curate the top five movies from each decade, I have encountered a delightful dilemma: the sheer abundance of cinematic treasures makes it nearly impossible to choose just five. Nevertheless, I have made my selections with the hope of sparking your curiosity and embarking you on an exhilerating journey of cinematic exploration.
While delving into Youtube, I noticed that accessing full movies often comes with a cost. However, I have discovered numerous free web sites where you can immerse yourself in these classics, along with many other remarkable films.
I have devoted considerable time and effort to this project. Despite this, I have encountered a technical challenge: in the pages with movie columns, adjusting the width of the first column which unfortunately aligns with the right border of the button group. The other four columns hold their own. That is why you will notice absence of fifth column in the movie clip guide. The actual project though will show all the columns.
Features:

Decade-wise Categorization: Movies are categorized by decade, starting from the 1940s.
Trailer Links: Each movie comes with a link to its trailer, giving viewers a quick glimpse of the film.
Full Movie Links: Where available, links to the full-length movies on YouTube are provided.
Interactive Index Page: The homepage features buttons for each decade, allowing easy navigation to the selected movie list.
Video Guide: A comprehensive video clip explains how to navigate and use the project effectively.

How to Use:

1. Navigate to the Index Page: Start by visiting the index page of the project.
2. Select a Decade: Click on the button corresponding to the decade you are interested in.
3. Explore Movies: Browse through the list of top five movies for the chosen decade.
4. Watch Trailers or Full Movies: Click on the links provided to watch the trailers or full movies on YouTube.

 Technologies Used:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- YouTube APIs (for trailers and movie links)

Project Structure:

- `index.html`: The main entry page with navigation buttons to each decade's movie list.
- `decade_pages/`: A folder containing individual HTML files for each decade's top movies.
- `assets/`: Contains static files like images and the video guide.
 Problems encountered: In the index page, the first movie column is wider than the other four columns which have same width 
as expected. It seems that the right border of the First column seems to align with the right border of the button group. I tried several 
combinations without success.
